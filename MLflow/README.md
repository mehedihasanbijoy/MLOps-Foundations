# MLflow
It is an open-source platform that manages the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, model packaging, deployment, and model registry.



# Why Use MLflow?
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that experiments can be recreated consistently.
- **Scalability**: Works across different ML frameworks and cloud platforms.
- **Collaboration**: Teams can share, review, and manage experiments efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Integrates with various ML libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, etc.).



# Main Concepts of MLflow
MLflow consists of four main components: MLflow Tracking, MLflow Projects, MLflow Models, and MLflow Model Registry.


## MLflow Tracking
MLflow Tracking is a system for logging and querying experiments, allowing users to track parameters, metrics, artifacts, and models.

- Runs: Each time you execute an ML experiment, MLflow creates a run, which records parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
- Experiments: A collection of runs that belong to a specific project or research task.
- Parameters: Input values used in the model (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
- Metrics: Performance indicators such as accuracy, loss, or F1-score.
- Artifacts: Files generated during training, such as models, plots, or logs.
- Logging Methods:
    - `mlflow.log_param("param_name", value)`: Logs a single parameter.
    - `mlflow.log_metric("metric_name", value)`: Logs a performance metric.
    - `mlflow.log_artifact("path_to_file")`: Saves a file as an artifact.


## MLflow Projects
MLflow Projects define the environment and dependencies required to reproduce an experiment.

- Project Structure: Each project is a directory or Git repository containing:
    - `MLproject` file (YAML-based configuration).
    - Code files (Python, R, etc.).
    - Dependency management (e.g., `conda.yaml` or `requirements.txt`).
- Reproducibility: Projects allow you to run experiments consistently across different environments.



## MLflow Models
MLflow Models standardize model packaging and deployment.

- Model Format: MLflow supports different formats for storing models, such as:
    - `mlflow.sklearn` for scikit-learn models.
    - `mlflow.pytorch` for PyTorch models.
    - `mlflow.tensorflow` for TensorFlow models.
- Flavors: MLflow allows models to be saved in different flavors (e.g., Python function, REST API).
- Deployment: Models can be deployed via:
    - MLflow Serving (`mlflow models serve`).
    - Integration with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
    - Docker and Kubernetes deployment.


## MLflow Model Registry
The Model Registry is a centralized repository for managing models in different stages.

- Model Versioning: Each registered model can have multiple versions.
- Lifecycle Stages:
    - `Staging`: For testing.
    - `Production`: For live use.
    - `Archived`: Retired models.
- Metadata & Annotations: Users can add tags and comments for better tracking.
